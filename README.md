Heart Disease Statistical Analysis Project
📊 Project Overview

This project performs inferential statistical analysis on a heart disease dataset to test three key healthcare hypotheses using Excel, SPSS, and Python. The analysis includes one-sample, two-sample, and ANOVA tests to examine relationships between cardiovascular health indicators.
🎯 Project Objectives

    Perform hypothesis testing on healthcare data using multiple statistical tools

    Compare results across different analytical platforms (Excel, SPSS, Python)

    Draw evidence-based conclusions about heart disease risk factors

📁 Dataset Information

Source: Kaggle - Heart Failure Prediction Dataset
Records: 918 patient observations
Variables: 12 clinical features including demographic, behavioral, and medical measurements
Key Variables Used:

    Age: Patient age in years

    Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level (mg/dL)

    MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved

    RestingBP: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)

    HeartDisease: Binary classification (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

    ChestPainType: Categorical variable with 4 types

🔬 Statistical Tests Performed
1. One-Sample T-Test

Research Question: Is the average cholesterol level significantly different from the standard medical reference value of 200 mg/dL?
2. Two-Sample T-Test

Research Question: Do patients with heart disease have significantly different maximum heart rates compared to healthy patients?
3. One-Way ANOVA Test

Research Question: Is there a significant difference in average resting blood pressure among patients with different types of chest pain?
